    "The objective from these experiments is to the identify the machine's patterns through Machine Learing models. A way to interpret this objective, is to visualize its sensor data, generate interesting features, and use those features at a machine learning model to predict its classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two possible problems approaches: \n",
    "- attribute a single class for each sample (multi-class classfication problem); \n",
    "- consider that multiple faults can happen at the same time (multi-label classification, can be considered binary classification for each fault).\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter problem is more realistic considering a few factors: \n",
    "- a multi-class approach fails when new classes appear (there must be an \"others\" class);\n",
    "- multiple faults DO happen in practice;\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are a few problems:\n",
    "- For this dataset, the classes are labeled in a way that each sample only has a single fault happening. Therefore, it is not fair to the multi-label model;\n",
    "- We turn a perfectly stratified dataset into a imbalanced dataset. Different metrics such as balanced accuracy, or ROC AUC must be used;\n",
    "- More parameters to tune, such as the threshold for the ROC curve. It is possible to fix a certain metric such as TPR to diminish FNs, trading-off for FPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few considerations:\n",
    "- it would be better to have different machines/sensors and have them separated in the training/testing sets to avoid a possibe data leakage, where the model learns specific configurations of the machine. It is not possible to do this with this dataset. \n",
    "- the classes are perfectly stratified for a multi-class approach, but will turn imbalanced when turning the problem into a multi-label."
